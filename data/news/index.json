Dessa kallas själamässodagar. Själamässan firas fyra gånger om året:\n\n- Vintersjälamässa – firas lördagen före de dödas mässa\n- Sommarsjälamässa – firas lördagen före pingst\n- Mikaelssjälamässa – firas före ärkeängeln Mikaels dag\n- Höstlig själamässa – även kallad Mitrovica-själamässa, eftersom den firas lördagen före Mitrovdan\n\nSjälamässan är en kyrklig helgdag då kristna besöker sina anhörigas gravar och ber till Gud för deras själar. Den infaller alltid på en lördag.\nDen viktigaste åminnelsen för de avlidna är proskomidian, som firas vid varje gudomlig liturgi. Förutom dessa böner och minneshandlingar har Kyrkan också fastställt särskilda dagar då vi minns våra bortgångna och besöker deras gravar.\n\nSjälamässan är en dag då man ihågkommer den tidpunkt då själen skiljs från kroppen – en medlem av Kyrkan som gått hädan. Den infaller alltid på en lördag, eftersom just lördagen under hela året är dagen då vi särskilt minns de döda. På själamässodagen är det en plikt att gå till kyrkogården. Då hålls en panihida eller minnesgudstjänst: sädeskorn välsignas, graven rökelsebeströs och ljus tänds för de avlidnas själar. Graven ska vara prydd och i ordnat skick.\n\nDet kokta vetet tas med till församlings- eller klosterkyrkan, samt till kyrkogården. På själamässodagen firas den heliga liturgin, varefter prästen häller vin över vetet, och efter gudstjänsten går man till de avlidnas gravar. Där tänds ljus, och prästen utför en ceremoni med rökelse över gravarna. Om våra avlidna ligger begravda långt borta och man inte kan besöka deras gravar, hålls hela gudstjänsten i kyrkan.\n\nVetet påminner symboliskt om Kristi ord att vetekornet bär först frukt när det dör – inte i jordens mörker, utan i solens ljus. Vetet är en symbol för den dödliga kroppen och den odödliga själen i Himmelrikets ljus.\nDet röda vinet, som prästen häller över vetet, symboliserar Guds barmhärtighet, som helar syndens sår.\nLjuset är en symbol för Kristi ljus. Han sade: Jag är världens ljus. Detta ljus påminner oss om det ljus med vilket Kristus upplyser de avlidnas själar. \n\nLjuset är en liten offergåva till Gud, som offrade sig själv för oss.\nAllmosan ges inte för att ”mata” den avlidnes själ, utan för att mata de fattiga och minnas den avlidne i bön.\n\nAllmosor delas ut på själamässodagar. Det finns också en annan typ av allmosa som bland oss har glömts bort: andlig allmosa – att ge andliga böcker som gåva.",

    "body": "![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a915510-07ef-487a-baff-a40cfd1bc6d2)\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church has designated special days dedicated to prayer for the dead. These are All Souls' Day. All Souls' Day is celebrated four times a year:\n\n- Winter All Souls' Day – celebrated on the Saturday before the Mass of the Dead\n- Summer All Souls' Day – celebrated on the Saturday before Pentecost\n- Michaelmas All Souls' Day – celebrated before Michaelmas\n- Autumn All Souls' Day - also called Mitrovska All Souls' Day because they are celebrated on the Saturday before Mitrovdan\n- All Souls' Day  is a church holiday when Christians visit the graves of their loved ones and offer prayers to God for them. It always falls on a Saturday.\n\nThe most important commemoration for the deceased is the Proskomidia, which is celebrated at every Divine Liturgy. In addition to these commemorations and prayers for the deceased, the Church has established special days when we remember our dear departed and visit their graves.\n\nAll Souls' Day  commemorates the day of the separation of the soul from the body, a member of the Church. It always falls on a Saturday, because it is also the day throughout the year when we remember the deceased. On All Souls' Day, it is obligatory to go to the cemetery. Then a memorial service or commemoration is held. Grain is blessed, the grave is incensed, and candles are lit for the repose of the souls of the deceased. The grave is obligatory to be decorated.\n\nThe milled or  cooked grain  is taken to the parish or monastery church, as well as to the cemetery. On All Souls' Day, the Holy Liturgy is served, and then the priest pours wine over the grain, and after the service, people go to the graves of the deceased. Candles are lit next to the graves, and the priest performs a rite and incenses the graves. If our deceased are buried far away and it is not possible to go to their graves, the entire rite is served in the church.\n\nWheat  symbolically reminds us of Christ's words that  the grain only bears fruit when it dies , and not in the darkness of the earth, but in the light of the sun. Wheat is a symbol of the mortal body and the immortal soul in the light of the Kingdom of Heaven.\nThe red wine , with which the priest pours the grain, signifies  God's mercy, which heals the wounds of sin .\nThe candle  is a symbol of the light of Christ. He said:  I am the light of the world . That light should remind us of the light with which Christ illuminates the souls of the deceased. The candle is a small sacrifice to God, who sacrificed himself for us.\nAlms  and alms are not given to feed the deceased, that is, so that his soul eats, but rather to  feed the poor and to remember the deceased in prayers .\nAlms are distributed on all-nighters  . There is another type of alms that has been forgotten among us:  spiritual alms . Spiritual alms is the donation of spiritual books.",

    "title": "The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist.",
    "body": "\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7229d702-8950-4d6c-adce-f2bcacfda87b)\n\n!Herod Antipas, the son of the old Herod, the murderer of the young children of Bethlehem at the time of the birth of the Lord Jesus, was the ruler of Galilee at the time of the preaching of John the Baptist. This Herod was married to the daughter of a certain Arabian prince, Aretas. But Herod, an evil offshoot from an evil root, had put away his lawful wife and unlawfully taken as his concubine Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, who was still alive. John the Baptist spoke out against this lawlessness and strongly rebuked Herod. Herod threw him into prison. During a feast in his palace at Sebasteia in Galilee, Salome, the daughter of Herodias and Philip, danced before the guests. And Herod, drunk with this dance, promised to give the dancer whatever she asked of him, even half of his kingdom. Persuaded by her mother, Salome demanded the head of John the Baptist. Herod ordered that John be beheaded in prison and his head be brought on a platter. John's disciples took the body of their teacher at night and buried it honorably, and Herodias pierced John's tongue with a needle and buried his head in an unclean place. What happened next with John's head can be read under February 24. But God's punishment soon overtook this group of evildoers. Prince Aretas, to clear his daughter's honor, attacked Herod with an army and beat him to death. The defeated Herod was sentenced by the Roman Caesar Caligula to exile, first to Gaul and then to Spain. As exiles, Herod and Herodias lived in poverty and humiliation, until the earth opened up and swallowed them up. And Salome died a cruel death on the river Sicoris (Sula). The death of St. John took place before Easter, and the celebration on August 29 was established because on that day the church was consecrated, which was built on his grave in Sebaste by Emperor Constantine and Empress Helena. The relics of John's disciples: Elisha and Obadiah, were also placed in that church. The venerable Justin testifies poignantly about this martyrdom of the holy Forerunner: Today the greatest of all born of women was executed – Saint John the Baptist and Forerunner of the Lord. On Good Friday, people killed God, crucified God. On today’s holy great feast, people killed the greatest man. The greatest, I say, is not me. What is the use of my praise for the great and glorious Forerunner of the Lord, whom the mouth of the Lord praised more than any other man, more than any Apostle, Angel, Prophet, Righteous or Wise. For the mouth of the Lord said of him: This is the greatest of all born of women. There is no greater praise in this world. And that is why today is a small Good Friday. Behold, foolish men have killed the greatest Righteous One. Does it bother them? Yes, it bothers the depraved King Herod and the fornicating Herodias. The Justice of God and the Truth of God bother the lawless, it bothers poor sinners, it bothers all those intoxicated by various passions. Behold, do not the Christ-fighters even today shout: Crucify him, crucify him! Do not the Christ-fighters even today seek the head of Jesus of Nazareth? They seek his head, let alone the head of John the Baptist. What is it? Has this world turned into a madhouse? People do not want God, they do not want the greatest Righteous One in this world. Who do you want? Who do you want? What will you replace Christ with? What Saint John the Baptist with? Yourself!? Oh! moths, oh! deadly mosquitoes! When people go crazy with pride, when they go crazy with self-love, then they do not need God, then they do not need the Justice of God. They proclaim themselves to be gods. They propose their small false truth as the great truth, the saving truth. They proclaim their small earthly, leprous justices as the greatest justices: we do not need the Justice of Christ, we do not want the Justice of God! Yes, people are blind in mind, blind in soul, they do not see, and they will not see, that in this world a man, a real man, cannot endure without God. Why? Well, because this world is full of Herods, full of Pharisees. The Herods seek the head of John the Baptist, the Herods seek the Head of all the Righteous Ones of the earth, and the Pharisees, the false scribes, and the false wise men of this world seek the death of the God-man Christ. Yes, today is the feast day, the second Good Friday. Why? Because there is no greater crime, except the crime committed on Good Friday, than the crime of this day, when Herod executed the greatest among those born of women. Why did the Savior so magnify the Holy Great John the Baptist as no one else among men? Why? Because, brothers, the Holy Forerunner embodied in himself, in his person, all the virtues of heaven, all the virtues of all the Prophets, all the Apostles, all the Martyrs, all the Angels of heaven, all the Confessors. Behold, today we celebrate the death, the beheading of the first Apostle among the Holy Apostles. For the Forerunner of the Lord, the first was sent by God to see and proclaim to the world the Savior of the world. Far before the Apostle Peter, before the Apostle Nathanael, before anyone else, he showed the world God Who became incarnate and appeared as the Lord Jesus Christ. The first Apostle, who saw the Holy Spirit descending from heaven upon the Lord Jesus when He was baptized in the Jordan, and proclaimed Him as the Son of God and Savior of the world. He, he and the first Evangelist among the Evangelists. He was the first to proclaim to the world and point out the Bearer of all the main news for the human race, the Lord Christ. The Lord Christ Himself – here is the Gospel, of heaven and earth, for the people of this world. – Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world! The Holy Forerunner summarized the entire Gospel in a few words. When he looked to the east, he spoke to the entire human race from Adam to this day: Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. The Kingdom of Heaven – behold Him – Jesus God from heaven. In Him is the Kingdom of Heaven. When he turned to the west, and looked at people drowned in sins and death, he also cried out to them: Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. When he looked to the north and south, the same people, all slaves of sin, slaves of death, slaves of demons. He cried out to everyone one glorious and holy and saving Gospel: People, repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. Such is the mighty Evangelist, such is he! When the Lord began the preaching of His Gospel, a powerful sermon, He took these words as the beginning and end of His Gospel: And Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. Behold, therefore the Holy Forerunner is the first Evangelist among the Evangelists of Christ. Today, Today people have felt an angel in the flesh, an earthly angel and a heavenly man – Saint John the Baptist. Not only did the Old Testament Prophet call the Forerunner the angel of the Lord, but the Lord Himself said that he was an angel sent before Him to prepare the way for Him. Not only a Prophet, the Savior said of the Baptist, but even more than a Prophet – the Angel of the Lord. And so the Holy Forerunner is, in fact, the first angel in the flesh, among the later numerous angels in the flesh, the saints of God, who lived on earth as angels of heaven, and were angels on earth, and in heaven remained men of God, holy men. Today, today we celebrate the great feast of the first among the New Testament Prophets. The Holy Prophet of the New Testament. Behold, he announced to the world that the Lord Christ appears to the world not only as the Savior but also as the Sanctifier, and as the Judge of the world. In His hand is an ax and a shovel: The Lord will cleanse the threshing floor of the earth on the day of the Terrible Judgment, and will winnow the chaff from the wheat, the righteous from the unrighteous. All this was seen by the Great and Glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist of the Lord. Therefore, today we celebrate him as the Holy Prophet of the New Testament killed by the wicked and evil king Herod. Footnote!
